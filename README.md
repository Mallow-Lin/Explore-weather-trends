# Explore-weather-trends
# Summary

In this project, will analyze local and global temperature data. Will compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

# Instructions

Will create a visualization, and describe the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

- Extract the data from the database. You’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live.
     - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
     - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
     
- Open up the CSV using Excel, Google sheets, Python or R. 

- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
